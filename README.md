## Hi there 👋

My name is Noor Zalouk from Egypt born in 2002. Graduated with a bachelor's degree in science in 2024. Advancements in AI grabbed my attention so I decided to learn more about it.
I learned programming, mathematics and machine learning doing projects along the way to solidify my knowledge. I hope that I can keep learning and contributing to this field.
Currently looking for my first role as a Data scientist or ML engineer.

## Tools and Frameworks

* NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn, PyTorch, HuggingFace
* MLflow, Apache Airflow
